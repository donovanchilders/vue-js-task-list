# task-list

Yet another Vue.js Task List application.

This application was created with the @vue/cli, so follow the directions below to install and run.

## About
When you load up the app, some default tasks will be added. You can check these off and delete them if you like.

Task changes - along with new tasks - will be saved to your browser's sessionStorage so that the changes will persist across reloads. New sessions should always load the default demo tasks.

You can clear sessionStorage by invoking the button in the appliation's footer, `Clear Session Storage`.
